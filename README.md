# nk-observer
Web app that monitors North Korean web space!

The app uses the popular nmap prgram to scan the allocated North Korean subnets (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_North_Korea) into XML files which are then taken by npmapdb and pushed into an SQLite database. The frontend is written with simple PHP and will be updated soon - the current front-end is just a preliminary interface for proof of concept.OS detetcion will also be added in future versions.
